        <h1>Now The Hungry Lion Roars</h1>
        <h2>by <strong>William Shakespeare</strong></h2>
        <h3>From "A Midsummer-Night's Dream," Act V. Scene 2</h3>

        <p>
            <em>PUCK sings:</em><br>
            NOW the hungry lion roars,<br>
            And the wolf behowls the moon;<br>
            Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,<br>
            All with weary task fordone.<br>
            Now the wasted brands do glow,<br>
            Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,<br>
            Puts the wretch that lies in woe<br>
            In remembrance of a shroud.<br>
            Now it is the time of night,<br>
            That the graves, all gaping wide,<br>
            Every one lets forth his sprite,<br>
            In the churchway paths to glide:<br>
            And we fairies, that do run<br>
            By the triple Hecate's team,<br>
            From the presence of the sun,<br>
            Following darkness like a dream,<br>
            Now are frolic; not a mouse<br>
            Shall disturb this hallowed house:<br>
            I am sent with broom before<br>
            To sweep the dust behind the door.<br>
        </p>
