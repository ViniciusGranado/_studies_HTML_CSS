        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the sugars, flour and spices; set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust; trim even with edge. Fill with apple mixture; dot with butter. Roll remaining crust to fit top of pie; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in crust.</li>
            <li>Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. Sprinkle with sugar. Cover edges loosely with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake at 375Â° for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 20-25 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>

        <h3>How many apples are in 6 cups?</h3>
        <p>Typically, 1 medium apple yields 1-1/3 cups sliced. For 6 cups of sliced apples, you will need about 5 medium apples.</p>

        <h3>How do you keep the bottom of a pie from getting soggy?</h3>
        <p>To avoid a pie bottom from getting soggy, allow the bottom crust to heat more rapidly than the rest of the pie. To do this, place a baking sheet in the oven while preheating and then bake your pie on the pan.</p>

        <h3>Is it better to bake a pie in glass or metal?</h3>
        <p>Both metal and glass pie plates work well for baking double-crust pies. But for single-crust pies that are pre-baked, a metal plate is preferred because it heats quicker and ensures a crisp crust.</p>
