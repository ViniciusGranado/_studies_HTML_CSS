        <h1>Arctic wolf</h1>

        <p>The Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), also known as the white wolf or polar wolf, is a subspecies of grey wolf native to Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands, from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island. It is a medium-sized subspecies, distinguished from the northwestern wolf by its smaller size, its whiter colouration, its narrower braincase, and larger carnassials. Since 1930, there has been a progressive reduction in size in Arctic wolf skulls, which is likely the result of wolf-dog hybridization.</p>

        
        <h2>Behaviour</h2>
        <p>The Arctic wolf is relatively unafraid of people, and can be coaxed to approach people in some areas. The wolves on Ellesmere Island do not fear humans, which is thought to be due to them seeing humans so little, and they will approach humans cautiously and curiously. Otto Sverdrup wrote that during the Fram expedition, a pair of wolves shadowed one of his teammates, who kept them at a distance by waving his ski pole. In 1977, a pair of scientists were approached by six wolves on Ellesmere Island, with one animal leaping at one of the scientists and grazing a cheek. A number of incidents involving aggressive wolves have occurred in Alert, Nunavut, where the wolves have lived in close proximity to the local weather station for decades and became habituated to humans. One of these wolves attacked 3 people, was shot, and tested positive for rabies.</p>

        <p>Very little is known about the movement of the Arctic wolves, mainly due to climate. The only time at which the wolf migrates is during the wintertime when there is complete darkness for 24 hours. This makes Arctic wolf movement hard to research. About 2,250 km (1,400 mi) south of the High Arctic, a wolf movement study took place in the wintertime in complete darkness, when the temperature was as low as −53 °C (−63 °F). The researchers found that wolves prey mainly on the muskoxen. There is no available information of the wolves' movements where the muskoxen were.</p>


        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>In the wild, Arctic wolves primarily prey on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskox" target='_blank'>muskoxen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_hare" target='_blank'>Arctic hares</a>. </p>
            
        <p>They have also been found to prey:</p>

        </ul>

        <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear'>Polar bears</a> are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs.</p>
