        <h1>Water</h1>
        <h2>The most precious natural resource</h2>

        <p>Water is one of the worldâ€™s most precious resources and one that is often taken for granted. Even today, access to safe drinking water is not a guarantee for many people across the world and as climate change takes its toll predictions point to this situation becoming even more dire in the future unless we start to take action now.</p>

        <p>The majority of people without access to water live in rural, isolated areas and spend hours collecting water. In many areas of water insecurity, pipes, taps, and wells do not exist, are not affordable, or are not currently designed to last. Safe, secure access to water ensures greater access to education for children, disease prevention, and economic security. The access to safe, clean water is a basic human right.</p>
