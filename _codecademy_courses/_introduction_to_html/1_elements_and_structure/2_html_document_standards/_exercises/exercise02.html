        <h1>Peanuts</h1>
        <h2>Are they good for your health?</h2>

        <p>Whether they’re crushed into butter, eaten right out of the shell, or sprinkled over a salad, peanuts are a popular snack. According to a recent survey of 2,000 adults by market research firm Mintel, 64 percent said they’d eaten peanuts within the past three months. That’s more than those who said they’d eaten almonds, cashews, pistachios, or trail mix.</p>

        <p>But an ounce of dry roasted peanuts has 166 calories and 14 grams of fat, leading some people—even some health professionals—to put them in the category of “sometimes” foods.</p>

        <p>A <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372883/' target='_blank'>recent survey</a> of about 760 dietitians, general practitioners (GPs), and nurse practitioners in New Zealand, for example, revealed that they were more likely to recommend that their patients eat tree nuts—such as almonds, cashews, pistachios, and walnuts—over peanuts; and most of the GPs and nurse practitioners rated peanuts as “slightly less healthy” than tree nuts.</p>

        <p>Such beliefs are misguided, says Vasanti Malik, Ph.D., a research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p>
        <p>“Peanuts are actually really healthy,” Malik says. “They’re certainly high in calories and fat, but the fat is good fat.” </p>
