        <h1>Density</h1>
        <p>The density (more precisely, the volumetric mass density; also known as specific mass), of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume.</p>

        <h2>Uses of density</h2>
        <p>One of the most common uses of density is in how different materials interact when mixed together. Wood floats in water because it has a lower density, while an anchor sinks because the metal has a higher density.</p>

        <p>When your automotive service station tests various liquids, like transmission fluid, it will pour some of the fluid into a hydrometer. The hydrometer has several calibrated objects, some of which float in the liquid. By observing which of the objects float, the service station employees can determine the density of the liquid. In the case of transmission fluid, this test reveals whether service station employees need to replace it immediately, or whether the fluid still has some life in it.</p>

        <p>Another common examples are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lava lamps</li>
            <li>Flying balloons</li>
            <li>Oil cleanup on oceans</li>
            <li>Floating icebergs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The history</h2>
        <p>In a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, Archimedes was given the task of determining whether King Hiero's goldsmith was embezzling gold during the manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper alloy. Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the displacement of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, "Eureka! Eureka!" (Εύρηκα! Greek "I have found it"). As a result, the term "eureka" entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.</p>

        <p>The story first appeared in written form in Vitruvius' books of architecture, two centuries after it supposedly took place. Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.</p>
