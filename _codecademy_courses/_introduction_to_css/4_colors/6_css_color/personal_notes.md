# Class 6: CSS color

In this class, we will explore the color options in CSS

## Concepts

In CSS, we have three main types os color notation:

- Named colors: We can use English words to determine a color. Words like `blue`, `red`, and `green` are accepted as valid values. There are 147 valid color names in CSS.

- Hexadecimal: This notation uses the concept of red, green, and blue light to achieve a color. It's written like this:

        #002532

It starts with a hash character, and three groups of numbers, in the case above, the numbers are `00`, `25`, and `32`. These are the values of red, green, and blue, respectively. We use hexadecimal numbers to represent the values, so numbers between 10 and 15 are represented with the letters A to F.

- RGB: This notation is similar to the hexadecimal, but uses the red, green, and blue values in decimal numbers. The syntax is this:

        rgb(0, 37, 50)

- HSL: Stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Its syntax is similar to the RGB notation:

        hsl(225, 100%, 25%)

The three values represent hue, saturation and, lightness, respectively.
